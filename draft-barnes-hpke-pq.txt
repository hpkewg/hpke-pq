  Post-Quantum and Post-Quantum/Traditional Hybrid Algorithms for HPKE
                      draft-barnes-hpke-pq-latest

Abstract

   Updating key exchange and public-key encryption protocols to resist
   attack by quantum computers is a high priority given the possibility
   of "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks.  Hybrid Public Key
   Encryption (HPKE) is a widely-used public key encryption scheme based
   on combining a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), a Key Derivation
   Function (KDF), and an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
   (AEAD) scheme.  In this document, we define KEM algorithms for HPKE
   based on both post-quantum KEMs and hybrid constructions of post-
   quantum KEMs with traditional KEMs, as well as a KDF based on SHA-3
   that is suitable for use with these KEMs.  When used with these
   algorithms, HPKE is resilient with respect to attack by a quantum
   computer.

1.  Introduction

   A cryptographically relevant quantum computer may or may not exist as
   of this writing.  The conventional wisdom, however, is that if one
   does not already, then it likely will within the lifetime of
   information that is cryptographically protected today.  Such a
   computer would have the ability to infer decapsulation keys from
   encapsulation keys used for traditional KEMs, e.g., KEMs based on
   Diffie-Hellman over finite fields or elliptic curves.  And it would
   be able to do this not just for data encrypted after the creation of
   the computer, but also for any information observed by the attacker
   previously, and stored for later decryption.  This is the so-called
   "harvest now, decrypt later" attack.

   It is thus a high priority for many organizations right not to
   migrate key exchange technologies to use "post-quantum" (PQ)
   algorithms, which are resistant to attack by a quantum computer
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers].  Since these PQ algorithms are
   relatively new, there is also interest in hybrid constructions
   combining PQ algorithms with traditional KEMs, so that if the PQ
   algorithm fails, then the traditional algorithm will still provide
   security, at least against classical attacks.

   Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is a widely-used public key
   encryption scheme based on combining a Key Encapsulation Mechanism
   (KEM), a Key Derivation Function (KDF), and an Authenticated
   Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) scheme [I-D.barnes-hpke-hpke].
   It is the foundation of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol,
   the Oblivious HTTP protocol, and the TLS Encrypted ClientHello
   extension [RFC9420] [RFC9458] [I-D.ietf-tls-esni].

   This document defines a collection of PQ and PQ/T KEM algorithms for
   HPKE, which allows HPKE to provide post-quantum security, as
   discussed in Section 7:

   *  ML-KEM-768

   *  ML-KEM-1024

   *  X25519 + ML-KEM-768

   *  P-256 + ML-KEM-768

   *  P-384 + ML-KEM-1024

   ML-KEM, X25519, and P-256/P-384 are defined in [FIPS203], [RFC7748],
   and [FIPS186], respectively.

   This selection of KEM algorithms was chosen to provide a reasonably
   consolidated set of algorithms (in the interest of broad
   interoperability), while still allowing HPKE users flexibility along
   a few axes:

   *  Pure PQ vs. PQ/T hybrid

   *  CFRG-defined vs. NIST-defined elliptic curves

   *  Different security levels (NIST category 3 vs. category 5)

   We also define HPKE KDF algorithms based on the SHA-3 family of hash
   functions.  SHA-3 is used internally to ML-KEM, and so it could be
   convenient for HPKE users using the KEM algorithms in this document
   to rely solely on SHA-3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We generally use the terminology defined in the HPKE specification
   [I-D.barnes-hpke-hpke].

   There are two meanings of "hybrid" in this document.  In the context
   of "hybrid public key encryption", it refers to the combination of an
   asymmetric KEM operaiton and a symmetric AEAD operation.  In the
   context of "PQ/T hybrid", refers to the combination of PQ and
   traditional KEMs.  For clarity, we always use "HPKE" for the former,
   and "PQ/T hybrid" for the latter.

3.  Pure Post-Quantum KEMs

   [[ TODO: Map ML-KEM to HPKE API, register 768 and 1024 ]]

4.  Post-Quantum/Traditional Hybrid KEMs

   [[ TODO: DHKEM + ML-KEM, in appropriate combinations ]]

   [[ TODO: Define HPKE API methods for the combination (just
   concatenating) ]]

5.  SHA-3 as an HPKE KDF

   [[ TODO: Defer until draft-ietf-hpke-hpke has a suitable definition
   ]]

6.  Selection of AEAD algorithms

   [[ TODO: Note that there's no need for new algorithms here; just use
   the longer key lengths ]]

7.  Security Considerations

   As discussed in the HPKE Security Considerations, HPKE is an IND-CCA2
   secure public-key encryption scheme if the KEM it uses is IND-CCA2
   secure.  It follows that HPKE is IND-CCA2 secure against a quantum
   attacker if it uses a KEM that provides IND-CCA2 security against a
   quantum attacker, i.e., a PQ KEM.  The KEM algorithms defined in this
   document provide this level of security.  ML-KEM itself is IND-CCA2
   secure, and the IND-CCA2 security of the hybrid constructions used in
   this document is established in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hybrid-kems].

   [[ TODO: Binding properties ]]

8.  IANA Considerations

   [[ TODO: Register KEM values ]]

   [[ TODO: Register KDF values ]]
