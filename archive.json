There is not a \"Recommended\" column in the registries right now, and I don't think there should be.  (Slim if any evidence for efficacy in guiding good choices.)

Should be soon.)\r\n\r\nThis PR just maps the KEM interface from those documents to the HPKE one, and registers KEM IDs for the hybrid KEMs.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a bit of terminology cleanup, we use \"IND-CCA2\" to talk about public-key encryption, and \"IND-CCA\" to talk about KEMs, since this seems to be the standard terminology.",
