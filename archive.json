There is really no significant downside to the PQ/T apart from a minor performance hit (and by minor I think negligible tbh). But the PQ-only has security risk attached to it. Putting it into the draft as an \"equal\" option is putting Internet users at risk atm, because implementors will implement it and provide it. (Understanding the nuanced discussions around PQ-only and PQ/T is difficult to convey even withing the crypto community so I think the task of providing meaningful \"guidance\" is borderline futile). See also my comment https://github.com/hpkewg/hpke/issues/17 which IMO would be another option where no choice needs to be made and both put in. Then, by having suitable categories such as a recommended column, notice how in the hypothetical year 2035 when ML-KEM is broken and no QC is here it will look a lot less bad if the recommended colum sais \"discouraged\" or something.",

Update draft-ietf-hpke-hpke to specify a separate Nseed for each KEM, and require that the input to DeriveKeyPair MUST have size Nseed\n2. For ML-KEM: Make `Nseed = 32` and define a DeriveKeyPair that expands the key (using SHAKE256 or SHA3_512)\n3. For the hybrids: Make `Nseed = 32`, as in -concrete-hybrid-kems\n\nThat would still leave the awkwardness of, say, an MLS ciphersuite using HKDF-SHA-384 for the key schedule and wanting to use these algorithms.  But I think that layer -- the layer where you connect two algorithms together -- is the right place to decide how to map inputs to outputs.  In this MLS case, for example, the MLS ciphersuite can simply specify that HKDF should produce a shorter output.\n\nProcedurally, I expect (1) is the biggest challenge.  As our charter says, \"The Standards Track and Informational versions must have identical behavior for any functionality that they both specify\".  However, I think increasing strictness is compatible with that objective.  An implementation built to the older, looser spec will continue to work with any calling code that expects the limitations of the new API.  @martinthomson, thoughts as chair?",

The only things you could possibly screw up in `DeriveCandidate_OneStage` are the inputs: `ikm`, the label `\"candidate\"`, the encoded counter, and the length `Nsk`.\n\nAnd maybe another way to think of this is to punt: If/when someone wants to register a DHKEM variant that uses a one-stage KDF, they'll get a code point and they can publish test vectors.\n\nGiven the above, I would be OK closing this.

Also, something about the RC builds of the elliptic curve library is currently broken, so I reverted to the stable one.\r\n\r\nTogether with recent changes to `concrete-hybrid-kems`, this should render the test vectors more sane.  As a first check, since Circl seemed to have HPKE and X-Wing implementations that could be plugged together, I added a small script that uses Circl to verify the test vectors.  Since the binary format is fixed now, as we get more implementations of the hybrid KEMs, it could be good to add more similar verifiers / CI.",
