There is really no significant downside to the PQ/T apart from a minor performance hit (and by minor I think negligible tbh). But the PQ-only has security risk attached to it. Putting it into the draft as an \"equal\" option is putting Internet users at risk atm, because implementors will implement it and provide it. (Understanding the nuanced discussions around PQ-only and PQ/T is difficult to convey even withing the crypto community so I think the task of providing meaningful \"guidance\" is borderline futile). See also my comment https://github.com/hpkewg/hpke/issues/17 which IMO would be another option where no choice needs to be made and both put in. Then, by having suitable categories such as a recommended column, notice how in the hypothetical year 2035 when ML-KEM is broken and no QC is here it will look a lot less bad if the recommended colum sais \"discouraged\" or something.",
