  Post-Quantum and Post-Quantum/Traditional Hybrid Algorithms for HPKE
                       draft-ietf-hpke-pq-latest

Abstract

   Updating key exchange and public-key encryption protocols to resist
   attack by quantum computers is a high priority given the possibility
   of "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks.  Hybrid Public Key
   Encryption (HPKE) is a widely-used public key encryption scheme based
   on combining a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), a Key Derivation
   Function (KDF), and an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
   (AEAD) scheme.  In this document, we define KEM algorithms for HPKE
   based on both post-quantum KEMs and hybrid constructions of post-
   quantum KEMs with traditional KEMs, as well as a KDF based on SHA-3
   that is suitable for use with these KEMs.  When used with these
   algorithms, HPKE is resilient with respect to attacks by a quantum
   computer.

1.  Introduction

   A cryptographically relevant quantum computer may or may not exist as
   of this writing.  The conventional wisdom, however, is that if one
   does not already, then it likely will within the lifetime of
   information that is cryptographically protected today.  Such a
   computer would have the ability to infer decapsulation keys from
   encapsulation keys used for traditional KEMs, e.g., KEMs based on
   Diffie-Hellman over finite fields or elliptic curves.  And it would
   be able to do this not just for data encrypted after the creation of
   the computer, but also for any information observed by the attacker
   previously, and stored for later decryption.  This is the so-called
   "harvest now, decrypt later" attack.

   It is thus a high priority for many organizations right now to
   migrate key exchange technologies to use "post-quantum" (PQ)
   algorithms, which are resistant to attack by a quantum computer
   [PQCE].  Since these PQ algorithms are relatively new, there is also
   interest in hybrid constructions combining PQ algorithms with
   traditional KEMs, so that if the PQ algorithm fails, then the
   traditional algorithm will still provide security, at least against
   classical attacks.

   Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is a widely-used public key
   encryption scheme based on combining a Key Encapsulation Mechanism
   (KEM), a Key Derivation Function (KDF), and an Authenticated
   Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) scheme [HPKE].  It is the
   foundation of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, the
   Oblivious HTTP protocol, and the TLS Encrypted ClientHello extension
   [RFC9420] [RFC9458] [TLS-ECH].

   This document defines a collection of PQ and post-quantum/traditional
   (PQ/T) KEM algorithms for HPKE, which allows HPKE to provide post-
   quantum security, as discussed in Section 7:

   *  ML-KEM-512

   *  ML-KEM-768

   *  ML-KEM-1024

   *  X25519 + ML-KEM-768

   *  P-256 + ML-KEM-768

   *  P-384 + ML-KEM-1024

   ML-KEM, X25519, and P-256/P-384 are defined in [FIPS203], [RFC7748],
   and [FIPS186], respectively.

   This selection of KEM algorithms was chosen to provide a reasonably
   consolidated set of algorithms (in the interest of broad
   interoperability), while still allowing HPKE users flexibility along
   a few axes:

   *  Pure PQ vs. PQ/T hybrid

   *  CFRG-defined vs. NIST-defined elliptic curves

   *  Different security levels (NIST category 3 vs. category 5)

   We also define HPKE KDF algorithms based on the SHA-3 family of hash
   functions.  SHA-3 is used internally to ML-KEM, and so it could be
   convenient for HPKE users using the KEM algorithms in this document
   to rely solely on SHA-3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We generally use the terminology defined in the HPKE specification
   [HPKE].

   There are two meanings of "hybrid" in this document.  In the context
   of "hybrid public key encryption", it refers to the combination of an
   asymmetric KEM operation and a symmetric AEAD operation.  In the
   context of "PQ/T hybrid", refers to the combination of PQ and
   traditional KEMs.  For clarity, we always use "HPKE" for the former,
   and "PQ/T hybrid" for the latter.

3.  ML-KEM

   The NIST Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism is defined
   in [FIPS203].  In this section, we define how to implement the HPKE
   KEM interface using ML-KEM.

   The HPKE DeriveKeyPair function uses the SHAKE256 KDF (see Section 5)
   to derive an ML-KEM decapsulation key in the 64-byte seed format,
   then uses the function ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal from [FIPS203] to
   compute the corresponding encapsulation key.

   def expandDecapsKey(dk):
       d = dk[:32]
       z = dk[32:]
       (ek, expanded_dk) = ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal(d, z)
       return (expanded_dk, ek)

   def DeriveKeyPair(ikm):
       dk = SHAKE256.LabeledDerive(ikm, "DeriveKeyPair", "", 64)
       (_expanded_dk, ek) = expandDecapsKey(dk)
       return (dk, ek)

   As discussed in [HPKE], the value of suite_id used within
   LabeledDerive identifies the KEM in use:

   *  ML-KEM-512: KEM\x00\x40 (hex: 4b454d0040)

   *  ML-KEM-768: KEM\x00\x41 (hex: 4b454d0041)

   *  ML-KEM-1024: KEM\x00\x42 (hex: 4b454d0042)

   The GenerateKeyPair function simply calls ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal with
   a pseudorandom dk value.  As long as the bytes supplied by random
   meet the randomness requirements of [FIPS203], this corresponds to
   the ML-KEM.KeyGen function, with the distinction that the
   decapsulation key is returned in seed format rather than the expanded
   form returned by ML-KEM.KeyGen.

   def GenerateKeyPair():
       dk = random(64)
       (_expanded_dk, ek) = expandDecapsKey(dk)
       return (dk, ek)

   The SerializePublicKey, DeserializePublicKey, SerializePrivateKey,
   and DeserializePrivateKey functions are both the identity function,
   since the ML-KEM already uses fixed-length byte strings for public
   encapsulation keys.  The length of the byte string is determined by
   the ML-KEM parameter set in use.

   The Encap function corresponds to the function ML-KEM.Encaps in
   [FIPS203], where an ML-KEM encapsulation key check failure causes an
   HPKE EncapError.

   The Decap function corresponds to the function ML-KEM.Decaps in
   [FIPS203], where any of an ML-KEM ciphertext check failure,
   decapsulation key check failure, or hash check failure causes an HPKE
   DecapError.  To be explicit, we derive the expanded decapsulation key
   from the 64-byte seed format and invoke ML-KEM.Decaps with it:

   def Decap(enc, skR):
       (expanded_dk, _ek) = expandDecapsKey(skR)
       return ML-KEM.Decaps(expanded_dk, enc)

   The constants Nsecret and Nsk are always 32 and 64, respectively.
   The constants Nenc and Npk depend on the ML-KEM parameter set in use;
   they are specified in Table 2.

      |  Note: While this document defines an HPKE KEM for ML-KEM-512 in
      |  the interest of completeness, implementors should generally
      |  prefer ML-KEM-768 or ML-KEM-1024, or the PQ/T hybrids described
      |  in Section 4.  According to current cryptanalysis, ML-KEM-512
      |  provides security compatible with a 128-bit security level (or
      |  NIST security category 1).  Given the relative novelty of ML-
      |  KEM, however, there is some concern that new cryptanalysis
      |  might reduce the security level of ML-KEM-512.  Use of ML-
      |  KEM-768 or ML-KEM-1024 acts as a hedge against cryptanalysis of
      |  ML-KEM that removes some bits of security but is not
      |  catastrophic, at a modest performance penalty.

4.  Hybrid KEMs with ECDH and ML-KEM

   [CONCRETE] defines a collection of concrete PQ/T hybrid KEMs.  These
   KEMs combine ML-KEM with a traditional ECDH group:

   MLKEM768-P256:  ML-KEM-768 and P-256
   MLKEM768-X25519:  ML-KEM-768 and X25519
   MLKEM1024-P384:  ML-KEM-1024 and P-384

   These KEMs satisfy the KEM interface defined in [GENERIC].  This
   interface maps to the KEM interface in [HPKE] in the following way:

   *  The HPKE DeriveKeyPair function uses the SHAKE256 KDF (see
      Section 5) to derive a 32-byte seed for the hybrid KEM, then uses
      the function DeriveKeyPair from [GENERIC] to compute the key pair
      for the hybrid KEM.  The input to this function SHOULD be at least
      32 bytes long.

   def DeriveKeyPair(ikm):
       seed = SHAKE256.LabeledDerive(ikm, "DeriveKeyPair", "", 32)
       return KEM.DeriveKeyPair(seed)

   *  The GenerateKeyPair, Encap, and Decap algorithms are identical.

   *  The SerializePublicKey, DeserializePublicKey, SerializePrivateKey,
      and DeserializePrivateKey algorithms are the identity, since
      encapsulation and decapsulation keys are already fixed-length byte
      strings.

   *  The constants map as follows:

      -  Nsecret = Nss

      -  Nenc = Nct

      -  Npk = Nek

      -  Nsk = Ndk

   As discussed in [HPKE], the value of suite_id used within
   LabeledDerive identifies the KEM in use:

   *  MLKEM768-P256: KEM\x00\x50 (hex: 4b454d0050)

   *  MLKEM768-X25519: KEM\x64\x7a (hex: 4b454d647a)

   *  MLKEM1024-P384: KEM\x00\x51 (hex: 4b454d0051)

5.  Single-Stage KDFs

   This section defines HPKE KDFs for eXtendable Output Functions (XOF)
   based on Keccak.  SHAKE is defined as part of the SHA-3 specification
   [FIPS202].  The related TurboSHAKE XOFs are defined in
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-kangarootwelve].

   The Derive() function for SHAKE is as follows, where <SIZE> is either
   128 or 256:

   def SHAKE<SIZE>.Derive(ikm, L):
       return SHAKE<SIZE>(M = ikm, d = 8*L)

   The Derive() function for TurboSHAKE is as follows, where <SIZE> is
   either 128 or 256:

   def TurboSHAKE<SIZE>.Derive(ikm, L):
       return TurboSHAKE<SIZE>(M = ikm, D = 0x1f, L)

   The Nh values for the KDFs defined in this section are listed in
   Table 1.

          +========+===============+====+===========+===========+
          | Value  | KDF           | Nh | Two-Stage | Reference |
          +========+===============+====+===========+===========+

          | 0x0013 | TurboSHAKE256 | 64 | N         | RFC XXXX  |

   [[ RFC EDITOR: Please change "XXXX" above to the RFC number assigned
   to this document. ]]

6.  Selection of AEAD Algorithms

   As discussed in Section 2.1 of [PQCE], the advent of quantum
   computers does not necessarily require changes in the AEAD algorithms
   used in HPKE.  However, some compliance regimes call for the use of
   AEAD algorithms with longer key lengths, for example, the AES-256-GCM
   or ChaCha20Poly1305 algorithms registered for HPKE instead of AES-
   128-GCM.

7.  Security Considerations

   As discussed in the HPKE Security Considerations, HPKE is an IND-CCA2
   secure public-key encryption scheme if the KEM it uses is IND-CCA
   secure.  It follows that HPKE is IND-CCA2 secure against a quantum
   attacker if it uses a KEM that provides IND-CCA security against a
   quantum attacker, i.e., a PQ KEM.  The KEM algorithms defined in this
   document provide this level of security.  ML-KEM itself is IND-CCA
   secure, and the IND-CCA security of the hybrid constructions used in
   this document is established in [CONCRETE].

   Another security property that is salient in some use cases is "key
   binding".  In [CDM23], these notions are referred to with the
   shorthand X-BIND-P-Q.  The most salient for protocol design provide
   assurances similar to those provided by transcript hashing in
   protocols like TLS:

   LEAK-BIND-K-PK:  If the sender and receiver have the same key (K,
      shared_secret above), then there is only one encapsulation key
      (PK, pk) that could have produced it, even if the decapsulation
      key is leaked to an attacker after the encryption has been done.

   LEAK-BIND-K-CT:  If the sender and receiver have the same key (K,
      shared_secret above), then there is only one KEM ciphertext (CT,
      enc) that could have produced it, even if the decapsulation key is
      leaked to an attacker after the encryption has been done.

   DHKEM and ML-KEM meet these properties, as shown in [CDM23].  The
   hybrid KEMs used in this document also provide these properties, as
   discussed in [GENERIC].

7.1.  PQ Hybrid vs. Pure PQ

   Assuming that ML-KEM is secure, either the PQ/T hybrid KEMs defined
   in Section 4 or the pure PQ KEMs defined in Section 3 provide
   security against a quantum attacker.  Hybrid KEMs can be used to
   provide security against a non-quantum attacker in the event of
   failures with regard to the PQ algorithm, including both
   implementation flaws as well as new cryptanalysis.  See [GENERIC] for
   further analysis of hybrid security properties.

7.2.  Asymmetric-Key-Authenticated Modes of RFC9180

   In the [RFC9180] version of HPKE, KEMs could optionally define the
   additional functions AuthEncap and AuthDecap.  These functions
   allowed a sender to authenticate the message to the recipient without
   interaction.

   The KEMs defined in this document do not support AuthEncap/AuthDecap
   and cannot be used to migrate uses of HPKE that rely on this mode.
   PSK-authenticated HPKE (Section 5.1.2 of [HPKE]) or digital
   signatures may be suitable alternatives.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This section requests that IANA perform three actions:

   1.  Update the entries in HPKE KEM Identifiers registry corresponding
       to ML-KEM algorithms.

   2.  Add entries to the HPKE KEM Identifiers registry for the PQ/T
       hybrid KEMs defined in this document.

   3.  Add entries to the HPKE KDF Identifiers registry for the SHA-3
       KDFs defined in this document.

8.1.  Updated ML-KEM KEM Entries

   IANA is requested to replace the entries in the HPKE KEM Identifiers
   registry for values 0x0040, 0x0041, and 0x0042 with the following
   values:

    +========+=============+=========+====+====+===+======+===========+
    | Value  | KEM         | Nsecret |Nenc|Npk |Nsk| Auth | Reference |
    +========+=============+=========+====+====+===+======+===========+
    | 0x0040 | ML-KEM-512  | 32      |768 |800 |64 | no   | RFCXXXX   |

8.2.  PQ/T Hybrid KEM Entries

   IANA is requested to replace the entry for the value 0x647a and add
   two entries for values 0x0050 and 0x0051 with the following values:

Appendix A.  Test Vectors

   Each section below contains test vectors for a single selection of
   HPKE algorithms and contains the following values:

   1.  Configuration information and private key material: This includes
       the mode, info string, HPKE ciphersuite identifiers (kem_id,
       kdf_id, aead_id), and all sender and recipient key material.  For
       each role S or R, (sender and recipient, respectively) key pairs
       are generated as (skX, pkX) = DeriveKeyPair(ikmX).  Each key pair
       (skX, pkX) is written in its serialized form, where skXm =
       SerializePrivateKey(skX) and pkXm = SerializePublicKey(pkX).  For
       the PSK mode, the shared PSK and PSK identifier are also
       included.

   2.  Context creation intermediate values: This includes the KEM
       outputs enc and shared_secret used to create the context, as well
       as the context values key, base_nonce, and exporter_secret.

   3.  Encryption test vectors: A fixed plaintext message is encrypted
       using different sequence numbers and AAD values using the context
       computed in (2).  Each test vector lists the sequence number and
       corresponding nonce computed with base_nonce, the plaintext
       message pt, AAD aad, and output ciphertext ct.

   4.  Export test vectors: Several exported values of the same length
       with differing context parameters are computed using the context
       computed in (2).  Each test vector lists the exporter_context,
       output length L, and resulting export value.

   These test vectors are also available in JSON format at
   [TestVectors].
