## Command Line Usage

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

Command line usage requires that you have the necessary software installed.  See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/SETUP.md).

## Reference Implementation

The `reference-implementation` directory contains reference implementations of
the algorithms defined in this document.  For the PQ/T hybrids, it uses the
reference implementation in [the repository for that
specification](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-concrete-hybrid-kems/).
Since these crates are not published, if you want to use the reference
implementation, you will need to make your own clone of that repo and adjust the
`path` in Cargo.toml to point to it.
